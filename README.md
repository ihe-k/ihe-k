Bridging systems science, AI, and equitable public health for smarter, fairer health futures.

# About Me
I’m an interdisciplinary analyst applying AI, statistical inference and systems thinking to complex health challenges. My work spans:
* Computational biology & multi-omics analysis (e.g., gene expression, biomarker discovery)
* Machine learning & simulation for behaviour prediction, health misinformation, and triage
* Health equity, qualitative synthesis, and policy-relevant modelling
* Human-centered design and decision support for health systems

I prioritise reproducible, open science, with tools spanning Python, R, IBM SPSS, LaTeX, Git and NVivo.

# Featured Projects
* GeneExpression_CRC/: PCA, clustering & biomarker discovery in colorectal cancer
* ART_Access_Review/: Systematic review on ethnic disparities in ART access across Africa & Europe
* HealthInfo_Contagion_Sim/: Agent-based simulation + ML modeling of health info spread & ideology on social platforms
* Pneumonia_Xray_ABM/: NLP + ML + X-ray classification + misinformation-driven behavior simulation
* Cognitive_AI_Triage/: Multimodal severity prediction and game-theoretic prioritization for neurological disorders

# Technical Tools:
R, Python, SPSS, limma, ggplot2, PCA, clustering, thematic synthesis, bootstrapping, LaTeX, Markdown, Git, Qualtrics, NVivo
