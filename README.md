# About Me
I’m an interdisciplinary analyst applying AI, statistical inference and systems thinking to complex health challenges. My work spans:
* Computational biology & multi-omics analysis (e.g., gene expression, biomarker discovery)
* Machine learning & simulation for behaviour prediction, health misinformation, and triage
* Health equity, qualitative synthesis, and policy-relevant modelling
* Human-centered design and decision support for health systems

I prioritise reproducible, open science, with tools spanning Python, R, IBM SPSS, LaTeX, Git and NVivo.

# Featured Projects

* Gift-Triggered-Health-Info-Contagion-Simulation/: Agent-based simulation + ML modeling of health info spread & ideology on social platforms
* Pneumonia/: NLP + ML + X-ray classification + misinformation-driven behavior simulation
* Cognitive_AI_Triage/: Multimodal severity prediction and game-theoretic prioritisation for neurological disorders
