# About Me
I'm an interdisciplinary analyst working at the intersection of AI, statistical inference, and systems thinking to solve complex health challenges. My work spans:

* Computational Biology & Bioinformatics
Gene expression analysis, biomarker discovery and multi-omics integration (e.g., PCA, logistic regression, clustering and survival analysis)
* Machine Learning & Explainability
Risk stratification, neural networks, Bayesian models, fairness audits, algorithmic bias mitigation and XAI tools
* Health Equity & Policy Modelling
Decision theory, scenario forecasting, game-theoretic simulations for public health systems and misinformation dynamics
* Digital Behaviour & Influence Analysis
Social network modelling, misinformation tracing, agent-based simulation of digital health behaviour
* Human-Centered Decision Support
Tools for triage, prioritisation, and uncertainty-aware forecasting in clinical and population health contexts

## Tools & Technologies
* Languages: Python, R, SQL and STATA
* Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, NumPy, ggplot2 and limma
* Statistical Techniques: PCA, logistic regression, ROC, Monte Carlo simulation and survival analysis
* ML/AI: Bayesian models, neural networks, forecast modelling and risk classification
* Simulation & Modelling: Multi-agent models, system dynamics and decision/game theory
* Data Tools: Tableau, Power BI, SPSS, NVivo, Git, Excel VBA and AWS
* Workflow: JIRA, Confluence, Agile (Scrum/Kanban) and PDSA

I prioritise reproducible, open science with tools spanning Python, R, IBM SPSS, LaTeX, Git and NVivo.
