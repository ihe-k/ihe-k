# Health Systems Portfolio

This portfolio showcases projects at the intersection of artificial intelligence, behavioural science and health systems. It demonstrates technical depth, social impact and systems-level thinking.

## Project Index

### 1. Gene Expression & Clustering in Colorectal Cancer
📁 [`Gene-Expression-CRC`](https://github.com/ihe-k/Multi-Omics-Data-Analysis-of-Biomarkers-in-Colorectal-Cancer-A-Systems-Approach)
> Dimensionality reduction and clustering of patient subtypes using ΔΔCt gene expression data.  
> Tools: PCA, MDS, logistic regression, bootstrapping, SPSS and R  
> Relevance: Precision oncology and biomarker discovery

### 2. ART Access & Health Equity (Systematic Review)
📁 [`ART-Access-Review`](https://github.com/ihe-k/Barriers-and-Patient-Experiences-Across-Ethnicities-in-Africa-and-Europe-Qual-Systematic-Review)
> Thematic synthesis of qualitative studies on infertility care access across Europe and Africa.  
> Methods: CASP, PRISMA and intersectional health equity analysis  
> Relevance: Health systems planning and inclusive service design

### 3. Social Contagion & Gift-Based Health Behavior Simulation
📁 [`Health-Info-Contagion-GBHB_Simulation`](https://github.com/ihe-k/Gift-Triggered-Health-Info-Contagion-Simulation)
> Predicting health info sharing using Random Forests and social network simulation.  
> Real-time visualization, agent behavior and reward-driven interventions.  
> Relevance: Public health communications, misinformation mitigation and digital health campaigns

### 4. Pneumonia Risk & Misinformation on Health Seeking Behaviours
📁 [`Pneumonia-Risk-and-Misinformation-Impact-on-Health-Seeking-Behaviours`](https://github.com/ihe-k/Pneumonia-Risk-and-Misinformation-Impact-on-Health-Seeking-Behaviours)
> ML and NLP pipeline for pneumonia detection and agent-based simulation of misinformation impact.  
> Components: Logistic Regression, misinformation scoring and care-seeking simulation

### 5. Cognitive Impairment Risk & Resource Allocation
📁 [`Cognitive-Impairment-Prediction`](https://github.com/ihe-k/Cognitive_AI_Triage)
> Multimodal ML, SHAP/LIME, game theory for triaging early cognitive decline  
> Modalities: Audio, simulated biometrics and neuroimaging embeddings  
> Relevance: AI for decision support in resource-constrained settings

### 6.Modelling the Spread of Health Misinformation in Gendered Digital Environments
📁 [`Modelling-the-Spread-of-Health-Misinformation-in-Gendered-Digital-Environments`](https://github.com/ihe-k/Modelling-the-Spread-of-Health-Misinformation-in-Gendered-Digital-Environments)
> Network-based agent modeling, time-series data analysis, data normalisation and visualisation using Python, NetworkX, Matplotlib, Numpy, Scipy 
> Relevance: Understanding how misinformation spreads differently between genders and the role of fact-checking in combating it in digital health communications

## Themes Across Projects

- **Health Equity:** Gender-aware design, underrepresented groups and access inequities/barriers  
- **AI for Public Good:** Misinformation mitigation, disease prevention and trust-driven modeling  
- **Systems Thinking:** Interventions modelled across populations and feedback loops  
- **Explainability & Fairness:** SHAP/LIME, transparent ML pipelines and human-centred evaluation
