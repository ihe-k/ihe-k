# Health Systems AI Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio showcases projects at the intersection of artificial intelligence, behavioural science and health systems. It demonstrates technical depth, social impact, and systems-level thinking.

## Project Index

### 1. Gene Expression & Clustering in Colorectal Cancer
📁 [`gene-expression-crc`](https://github.com/ihe-k/Multi-Omics-Data-Analysis-of-Biomarkers-in-Colorectal-Cancer-A-Systems-Approach)
> Dimensionality reduction and clustering of patient subtypes using ΔΔCt gene expression data.  
> Tools: PCA, MDS, bootstrapping, SPSS and R  
> Relevance: Precision oncology & biomarker discovery

### 2. ART Access & Health Equity (Systematic Review)
📁 [`art-access-review`](./art-access-review/)
> Thematic synthesis of qualitative studies on infertility care access across Europe and Africa.  
> Methods: CASP, PRISMA and intersectional health equity analysis  
> Relevance: Health systems planning & inclusive service design

### 3. Social Contagion & Gift-Based Health Behavior Simulation
📁 [`health-info-contagion`](./health-info-contagion/)
> Predicting health info sharing using Random Forests & social network simulation.  
> Real-time visualization, agent behavior, and reward-driven interventions.  
> Relevance: Public health communications, misinformation mitigation and digital health campaigns

### 4. Pneumonia Risk & Misinformation ABM
📁 [`pneumonia-risk-simulation`](./pneumonia-risk-simulation/)
> ML & NLP pipeline for pneumonia detection and agent-based simulation of misinformation impact.  
> Components: Logistic Regression, misinformation scoring and care-seeking simulation

### 5. Cognitive Impairment Risk & Resource Allocation
📁 [`cognitive-impairment-prediction`](./cognitive-impairment-prediction/)
> Multimodal ML, SHAP/LIME, game theory for triaging early cognitive decline  
> Modalities: Audio, simulated biometrics and neuroimaging embeddings  
> Relevance: AI for decision support in resource-constrained settings

## 🌍 Themes Across Projects

- **Health Equity:** Gender-aware design, underrepresented groups and access inequities/barriers  
- **AI for Public Good:** Misinformation mitigation, disease prevention and trust-driven modeling  
- **Systems Thinking:** Interventions modelled across populations and feedback loops  
- **Explainability & Fairness:** SHAP/LIME, transparent ML pipelines and human-centred evaluation
